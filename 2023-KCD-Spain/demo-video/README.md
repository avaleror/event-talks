# How to watch the demo
The demo was recorded using "https://asciinema.org/", just install it and use `asciinema play tmp7jwao48n-ascii.cast` to watch it.
Take into account that the demo ends once we get the port of the video app, then it is needed to create the SSH tunnel to the edge nodeand connect to http://localhost:50000/
